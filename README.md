## Objective

To create a carrer service platform dedicated for students to help them post and update their portfolio, as well as letting employers post jobs.

Students will be able to:
  - Create/Modify their profiles
  - Upload their resume
  - View Job postings
  - Apply to said postings
  - Receive notification when called for an interview
  
Employers will be able to:
  - Create/Manage their job posts

As well as Admins who will be able to manage and overview the job postings and user profiles.
