SOEN 341 Project Repository - Team 1

## Objective

To create a carrer service platform dedicated for students to help them post and update their portfolio, as well as letting employers post jobs.

## Project Description

Language & Techniques: TBD

We will be developping an online carrer services system where both the Employers and Employees will create accounts and log in with their email and passwords.

Students will be able to:
  - Create/Modify their profiles
  - Upload their resume
  - View Job postings
  - Apply to said postings
  - Receive notification when called for an interview
  
Employers will be able to:
  - Create/Manage their job posts
  - Review candidates applications
  - Receive notification when students apply

As well as Admins who will be able to manage and overview the job postings and user profiles.
